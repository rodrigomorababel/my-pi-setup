# my-pi-setup

Rodri's personal pi package for the Babel machine: extensions, skills, and themes, all in one place. Published publicly at `github.com/rodrigomorababel/my-pi-setup`.

## Layout

- `extensions/` — pi extensions (auto-discovered when this folder is loaded as a package)
- `skills/` — pi skills (add `SKILL.md` folders here)
- `themes/` — pi themes (add `.json` theme files here)

## Loading locally

This folder is registered in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` under `packages` as a local path, so any new `.ts` file dropped in `extensions/` is picked up automatically on `/reload`.

## Fullscreen scrolling

`ui-customization` sets mouse-wheel/trackpad scrolling to **5 lines per tick**
without modifying Pi's installed files. Use `/reload` after updating this local
package; the override also reapplies when switching TUI modes in `/settings`.
Regular terminal scrollback and keyboard scrolling are unchanged.

Pi currently has no public runtime setter for this preference, so the extension
uses a guarded override of the fullscreen renderer's `wheelScrollLines` field.
It restores the original value on unload and safely skips incompatible renderers.
A future Pi internal change may require updating this small compatibility shim.
The old `patches/pi-wheel-scroll/apply.sh` script is no longer needed.

## Publishing

This folder is already a git repo with `origin` set to the public GitHub repo:

```bash
# push the latest local state
git add -A && git commit -m "wip"
git push -u origin main
```

On another machine, install directly from the repo:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/rodrigomorababel/my-pi-setup
```
